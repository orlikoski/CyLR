# CyLR Custom File Path Collection Template #
#===========================================#
#
# This file contains example methods for specifying file or folder paths to 
# collect with CyLR.
#

#################
# General Usage #
#################
#
# CyLR contains default paths per-operating system that it will collect if you
# do not specify this file. This file allows you to replace or extend the 
# default collection capability of CyLR.
#
# To configure CyLR to only collect the paths specified in this file, you can 
# provide this file at execution time as `CyLR.exe -c custom.txt` (where 
# custom.txt is this file's name and relative location). If you would like to
# collect both default and custom items, you can accomplish this with `-d` in 
# place of `-c`. If you only want to collect default items, you can omit either
# argument.
#

###################################
# Specifying custom path patterns #
###################################
#
# This configuration file supports comments, meaning lines with a leading `#`
# are ignored and not evaluated further; this is for the purpose of custom file 
# documentation, such as in this file, and for your own documentation as you 
# build out custom configurations for collections.
#
# When specifying a file or folder path to collect, you will want to use the 
# format of:
#   {pattern_type}	{file_or_folder_path}
#
# This format specifies the pattern type and target folder or file path, 
# delimited by a tab character. *Please be sure to validate that the delimiter 
# is a tab character and not a series of space characters.*
#
# *Please note distinction between file and folder pattern support.*
#
# There are four supported pattern types:
# * static -> Full path specification to a specific file 
# * glob -> Supports glob patterns for collection, such as `/path/**` or 
#           `/Users/*/.*history`. Where possible, this should be used in place
#           of regex due to performance. Most common use case is to recursively
#           collect a path with a pattern such as `/path/**`.
# * regex -> Support regular expressions in paths.
# * force -> Try to collect a static path even if the path is not found during
#            the file system enumeration.
#
# There is no requirements for the file path specified so long as it is tab 
# delimited from the pattern type. The file path can contain spaces and special
# characters so long as the dotnet file system library is able to interpret it.
#
# Please note that in order to collect all items in a folder, or recursively on
# a path, you will need to use glob paths. We will dive into more details for 
# each of these pattern types below.
#

#***************************#
# * IMPORTANT INFORMATION * #
#***************************#
#
# All patterns (except force) will attempt to match against an enumeration of 
# files on a system. This enumeration is performed by an internal function and
# is subject to the permissions granted at runtime. If a discovered path is 
# responsive to a pattern, it is added to the collection queue.
#
# The `force` pattern type specifies to attempt collection regardless of 
# whether the file is available through enumeration. For this reason, it must
# be a static full path for collection. 
#
# All pattern matching is case insensitive.
#
# Please specify the path delimiter for the system targeted. This means "/" for
# UNIX-like systems and "\" for Windows systems.
#

#+++++++++++++++++#
# Static patterns #
#+++++++++++++++++#
# 
# This pattern format is the most basic and can be used to collect a single
# file at a known location. This path must be discovered during file system 
# enumeration to queue for collection.
#
# Examples:
static	C:\Windows\System32\Config\SOFTWARE
static	/etc/group

#++++++++++++++++#
# Force patterns #
#++++++++++++++++#
# 
# This pattern format is the the same as static, but will add the file to the 
# collection queue regardless of whether the file is present in the file system
# enumeration operation. 
# 
# This is useful for collecting hidden/hard to access artifacts such as 
# alternate data streams. 
#
# Examples:
force	C:\$Extend\$UsnJrnl:$J


#++++++++++++++++#
# Glob patterns #
#++++++++++++++++#
# 
# This pattern format is useful for when a basic pattern is needed to collect
# responsive files. 
#
# Recursive collections
#
# The most common use case is for collecting files recursively. This is
# achieved through using two sequential asterisk characters at the tail end of 
# the path.
#
# Examples:
glob	/var/log/**

# Wildcards
#
# Another common use case is the wildcard, specified as a single asterisk 
# character within a path segment. This Wildcard will match any character 
# except a path delimiter. This means we can specify patterns that match a 
# particular file name within any sub directory. 
#
# We can also use wildcards to match on parts of a file name within a path 
# segment. Some use cases include collecting all files with a particular 
# extension or all files with the same name but differing extensions.
#
# Examples:
glob	C:\Users\*\NTUser.dat
glob	/home/*/.bash_history
glob	C:\Users\*\Appdata\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Recent\*.lnk
glob	/root/.*_history

# Other patterns
# 
# Globbing supports more patterns specified here: 
#  * https://github.com/dazinator/DotNet.Glob/blob/a21476b1078a3b49070bdb4bfde07030739e641d/README.md
#
# You can also combine the patterns into a single line, allowing you to specify
# patterns like those below. While regex may provide a more succinct manner 
# to specify the pattern, glob should be favored for performance reasons.
#
# Examples:
glob	C:\Windows\Temp\[A-Z][A-Z][A-Z][A-Z]\*.exe
glob	C:\ProgramData\[A-Z][A-Z][A-Z][A-Z].exe
glob	C:\**\*.docm
glob	C:\**\r*.exe

#++++++++++++++++#
# Regex patterns #
#++++++++++++++++#
#
# Allows the specification of advanced patterns for detection. This is the 
# slowest method and should be leveraged if pattern functionality available 
# through the other options is insufficient.
#
# This supports patterns specified by dotnet's regex implementation, documented
# here: 
# 
#
# Please note that the patterns are matched as a substring across a full path. 
# This means a pattern of `[0-9]{8}` would match on any file system path 
# containing eight numbers sequentially. You can leverage `^` to indicate the 
# start of a file path, and `$` to denote the end. 
#
# Examples:
regex	^C:\ProgramData\[A-Za-z]{8}\[A-Za-z]{5}.exe$
regex	[0-9]+.exe
